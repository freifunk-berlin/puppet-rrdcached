# Network socket address requests.  Use in conjunction with SOCKFILE to
# also listen on INET domain sockets.  The option is a lower-case ell
# ASCII 108 = 0x6c, and should be repeated for each address.  The
# parameter is an optional IP address, followed by an optional port with
# a colon separating it from the address.  The empty string is
# interpreted as "open sockets on the default port on all available
# interfaces", but generally does not pass through init script functions
# so use -L with no parameters for that configuration.

# Any other options not specifically supported by the script (-P, -f,
# -F, -B).
